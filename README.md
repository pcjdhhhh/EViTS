# EViTS: Can Vision-Based Pretrained Models Help with Time Series Similarity Search under Elastic Distances?
This repository is the official implementation of [Can Vision-Based Pretrained Models Help with Time Series Similarity Search under Elastic Distances?], 
submitted to AAAI 2026  (Under Review)

## The overall execution process of applying the EViTS algorithm to time series similarity search.

## Usage

Our code is easy to run; Run to_image.py to convert time series into images, fine_tune_model.py to fine-tune the pretrained vision model, and image_to_features_using_tune.py to extract features. Query accuracy can be evaluated by executing main_accuracy.py, while query efficiency can be measured by running main_efficiency.py.

## The UCR time series.

We directly read the UCR dataset through the interface of the aeon library.

**Requirements**: NumPy, scipy, matplotlib, aeon, sklearn, numba, pandas, pymetis, random, sktime,timm,pytorch


## Acknowledgments

We express our gratitude to Dr.Eamonn Keogh and his colleagues for providing the UCR datasets [1] used in this article.



Thanks to the authors of aeon[2],sktime[3], and GLB[4] for providing such excellent libraries!
